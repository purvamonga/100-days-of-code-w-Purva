# 100-days-of-code-w-Purva
Hello everyone!
This repository is more than just code, it’s my commitment to discipline, consistency, and growth. Over the next 100 days, 
I’ll be learning and practicing in public to stay accountable and build momentum.

**Goals-**
Build the habit of showing up every day
Sharpen problem-solving and coding skills
Stay consistent through public practice

Practicing in public is the best way to stay consistent and I’m excited to share this journey with you!
